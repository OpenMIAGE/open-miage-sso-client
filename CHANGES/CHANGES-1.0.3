* client Changes
  * spelling mistake fixed: Controler => Controller in all class, method names

* libraries Changes
  * OpenM-SSO archive file tree reworked.
    Now manage OpenM-SSO as a library like external library used by OpenM-SSO. 
    External library version management is easier because of pushed in directory
    containing version (ex.: 'openid/2.0.2').
