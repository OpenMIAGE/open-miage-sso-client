OpenM_SSO / client / 1.0.2

This package is provided by www.open-miage.org

Compatibility:
 - tested with PHP 5.2.17, 5.3.17, 5.4.6

Because of using OpenID from Janrain (https://github.com/openid/php-openid/): need to install OpenID dependencies (already installed in most of hosting offers).

   - Enable either the GMP extension or Bcmath extension. (GMP is
     STRONGLY recommended because it's MUCH faster!)  This is
     required.

   - Enable the CURL extension.

This package used *.example.open-miage.fr services (all is already setup).

To use ./example :
 - copy ./example and ./src under the same directory on a http server
 - launch ./example/ http url on server that host your example

This package provide two examples:
 - an example without api (./example/withoutAPI/) using : for site that whant to use OpenM_ID connection for using their web site
 - an example with api (./example/withAPI/) using : for API client interface that will be implemented for next (ex.: OpenM_Book, etc.)

NB: to use example with api, you need to launch ./example/withAPI/installer.php and after ./example/withAPI/installer2.php
that will install your client under api called in example and add client rights to call all required method on api.
/!\attention/!\ you need to connect under OpenM-ID example with admin account (login: admin@openm.id / password: admin)

This package provide a generic source code for developpers:
 - under (./example/gen_code_for_my_client/) you have an installer (install.php and install2.php) to open access to an api, and the source code to access on it.
